We lovingly create handcrafted premium honey that will change the way you think about honey. 
We make it the way nature intended, with bees drawing nectar from wildflower blossoms across superior forage lands, 
tended by trusted beekeepers, using responsible practices that respect the environment. Each product is infused with 
the elements of aroma, memory, place and beauty traditions from across the globe. Our honies carry with them stories 
and maps of their discoveries. Always striving to inspire and to be inspired. That's why Brutal Honey is the Beesponsible honey .
Brutal Bees with Love, Angel + Nyjia + Katie
